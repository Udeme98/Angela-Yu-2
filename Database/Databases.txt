Databases:
We Databases for the sole purpose of Data persistance.

Types of Databases:
1. SQL Databases
2. NoSQL Databases

SQL Databases
* Structured Query Language(SQL). A programming Language that allows you to query a database that is that particular structure format.
* SQL has been around for long.

Record:
* A record, also called a 'row', is each individual entry that exist in a table. 
* A record is a horizontal entry in a table.

Some Important SQL Commands:

* UPDATE - Updates data in a database
* DELETE - Deletes data in a database
* INSERT INTO - Inserts data in a database
* CREATE DATABASE - Creates a new database
* ALTER DATABASE - Modifies a new database
